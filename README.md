## Why WheeledAI?

### The Challenge

Rideshare drivers often face the hassle of scheduling and attending in-person vehicle inspections, which can be time-consuming, very costly, and delays their ability to start earning income. This is especially problematic for drivers who are new to the rideshare industry and are unfamiliar with the inspection process.

### The Solution

WheeledAI leverages cutting-edge AI and computer vision technologies to revolutionize the inspection process. By automating the inspection of rideshare vehicles, WheeledAI aims to:

- Improve efficiency: No more waiting for inspection appointments.
- Reduce costs: A cost-effective alternative to traditional inspections.
- Enhance safety: Ensures vehicles meet safety and compliance standards.
- Scale seamlessly: Accommodates a growing number of rideshare drivers.
- Ease of use: Drivers can complete inspections from the comfort of their homes, without ever leaving their driveway. Direct integration with rideshare platforms further simplifies the process.

## Key Features

- AI-Powered Inspection: Utilizes computer vision to detect and assess vehicle components (i.e. odometer, tire tread, seatbelts, etc.).
- Media Handling: Efficiently stores user-uploaded images and videos of their vehicles.
- User-Friendly Interface: Guides drivers through the inspection process with ease. Users can complete their inspection on a variety of different devices.
- Scalable Infrastructure: Handles a large volume of inspections concurrently.
- Data Privacy: Ensures user data security and compliance with regulations.
- Quick, Accurate Results: Provides drivers with instant feedback on their inspection results, along with actionable insights. Drivers can also view their inspection history and track their progress over time.
